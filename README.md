# Loan Risk Classifier.

### What does the code do?

In this notebook, we take data collected by the "Lending Club" [(Dataset Link)](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club) over 2007-2020 for loans and how many applications were accepted or rejected, we build up a random forest model by considering multiple factors such as:

1. Loan Amount.
2. Risk Score.
3. Employment Length.
4. Debt to Income Ratio.

And the model then predicts if approving loans to applicants would be safe.
